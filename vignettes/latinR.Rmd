abstract: |
  The main goal of **pRycollection** is to provide datasets about Paraguay
  for research and teaching that are not easily found or accessible. 
  Data and metadata often live separate lives, making data analysis
  difficult. The data package was build from the beginning with FAIR
  principles in mind. FAIR stands for **F**indable, **A**ccessible,
  **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable.
  These principles are critical to maximizing the impact and value of
  data in research and practice.
